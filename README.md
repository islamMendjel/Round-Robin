# Round-Robin
This C program implements a simple priority-based CPU scheduling algorithm using three priority levels and round-robin scheduling within each priority level. It simulates the execution of multiple processes with different arrival times, priorities, and execution times, and calculates various performance metrics such as turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each process.

Key Features:

    Implements a priority-based CPU scheduling algorithm with three priority levels.
    Utilizes round-robin scheduling within each priority level with predefined time quantum values.
    Calculates performance metrics including turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each process.
    Provides input validation for process attributes such as arrival time, priority, and execution time.
    Displays the process execution details and performance metrics in a tabular format.

Usage:

    Compile the program using a C compiler (gcc recommended).
    Run the compiled executable.
    Enter the number of processes and input the attributes (arrival time, priority, and execution time) for each process as prompted.
    View the output displaying the process execution details and performance metrics.
